# Opencode Loop Harness

An autonomous-development **runtime** you drop into any project. You dump intake;
a Ralph loop (two loops, a Decision Engine, gates, on-disk memory) builds it,
and **never stops to ask you what to do**. It decides, records why, and keeps going.

## Install

Open OpenCode at your project root and paste:

```
Install the Opencode Loop Harness (an autonomous-development runtime, github.com/PoBruno/opencode-harness-loop) into THIS project. Read this file in full and follow it end to end as the single source of truth:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PoBruno/opencode-harness-loop/main/INSTALL.md
Don't skip phases. Stop and ask before any destructive action.
```

One instruction. [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) is the whole playbook ("the brain") —
the agent clones, recons your code, installs, generates the specs, and cleans up.

## How it works

```
  Half Loop (you dump, it never asks)      Main Loop (autonomous)
  ───────────────────────────────────      ──────────────────────
  you ─► desk ─► inbox.md ─► groom ─► planner ─► build ─► review ─► distill
                             (WSJF)  (decide) (code)  (gates)   (skills)
```

- **desk** is the only agent you talk to — it files your dump into the inbox.
- The **Decision Engine** resolves every ambiguity mechanically: WSJF priority,
  vertical-slice decomposition, precedence hierarchy, one-way/two-way doors,
  assumption logging. No `ask:`, ever.
- **Invariants** (you write once) are the only absolute veto; **gates** keep the
  code correct. A stall **escalates** to a fresh decision instead of halting.
- The only thing that ever waits on you is a missing external resource (an API
  key) → one task parks, the loop keeps flowing.
- Every decision is on the bus → live **Decision Log** (TUI) + static HTML dashboard.

Full design: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Daily use

```bash
opencode --agent desk                          # dump work into the inbox
bash .harness/loop.sh                          # run (--once | --daemon)
python .harness/presentation/textual/app.py    # TUI: r run · x stop · d decisions · q quit
bash .harness/dashboard.sh                      # regenerate the static dashboard
```

Inside OpenCode: `/status` · `/consistency` · `/audit` · `/bootstrap`.

## Requirements

Linux + Docker · `bash git jq coreutils` · `opencode` (authenticated). TUI is
optional (`pip install -r .harness/presentation/textual/requirements.txt`).
